          ASSUMPTION OF RISK, WAIVER, AND RELEASE
        </h4>
        <p>
          By engaging Hair MW (for the purposes hereof referred to together
          herein as the “Company”) to provide Cryoskin treatments
          (“Services”), I hereby acknowledge on behalf of myself, my heirs,
          personal representatives and/or assigns, that there are certain
          inherent risks and dangers associated with receiving Services. At
          all times, I shall comply with all stated and customary terms,
          posted safety signs, rules, and verbal instructions given to me by
          staff. If in the subjective opinion of the Company’s staff, I would
          be at physical risk in receiving Services, I understand and agree
          that I may be denied access to Services until I furnish the Company
          with an opinion letter from my medical doctor, at my sole cost and
          expense, specifically addressing the Company’s concerns and stating
          that the Company’s concerns are unfounded.
        </p>

        <p>
          I hereby (1) agree to assume full responsibility for any and all
          injuries or damage which are sustained or aggravated by me in
          relation to my receiving of the Services, (2) release, indemnify,
          and hold harmless the Company, its direct and indirect parent,
          subsidiary affiliate entities, and each of their respective
          officers, directors, members, employees, representatives and agents,
          and each of their respective successors and assigns and all others,
          from any and all responsibility, claims, actions, suits, procedures,
          costs, expenses, damages, and liabilities to the fullest extent
          allowed by law arising out of or in any way related to the Services,
          and (3) represent that: (a) I have no medical or physical condition
          that would prevent me from receiving the Services, (b) I do not have
          a physical or mental condition that would put me in any physical or
          medical danger, (c) I have not been instructed by a physician to not
          receive Services, (d) no warranty or guarantee, or other assurance,
          has been made to me covering the results of the Services, (e)
          knowing the risks involved I nevertheless chose to voluntarily
          request the Services. Notwithstanding the foregoing (and by way of
          illustration only and not limitation) if any of the following
          contraindications apply to me or if I’m unsure for any reason, I
          hereby acknowledge the Company’s recommendation that I consult a
          medical physician before receiving Services.
